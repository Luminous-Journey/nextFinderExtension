## On Chrome:
### Step 1: Download the Extension File

First, you need to download the extension file to your computer. Typically, extension files have a ".zip" or ".crx" extension. You can find these files on the extension's official website or other trusted sources.

### Step 2: Extract the Extension File

If the extension file is in a ".zip" format, you'll need to extract its contents. Right-click on the file and choose the "Extract" or "Unzip" option. This will create a folder with the extension's files.

### Step 3: Open the Browser's Extension Page

Open your web browser and navigate to the extension management page. The location of this page varies by browser:

Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge: Type `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter.  
Mozilla Firefox: Type `about:addons` in the address bar and press Enter.  
Safari: Open Safari, go to the "Safari" menu, and select "Preferences." Then, click on the "Extensions" tab.  

## Step 4: Enable Developer Mode (if needed)

In most browsers, you need to enable developer mode to install extensions manually. Look for a toggle or checkbox labeled "Developer mode" and make sure it's turned on.

### Step 5: Install the Extension

Now, look for an option like "Load unpacked," "Load extension," or "Install add-on from file." Click on it, and a file dialog will appear.

Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files and select the main folder containing those files. Click "Open" or "Select Folder" to install the extension.

### Step 6: Confirm Installation

After selecting the extension folder, the browser should confirm the successful installation of the extension. You may see the extension's icon appear in your browser toolbar.
